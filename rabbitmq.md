# Docs for setting up the rabbitmq cluster with ubuntu server and enabling TLS over protocols such as amqp, and https.


# 1. Changing the hostname of the servers to refer then as the master and worker nodes 

**apt update** :- update packages of your ubuntu server. 

**vi  /etc/hosts** ------------- here add the private ip of the other nodes so that it will help us to differenciate between the worker and the master nodes.

**for Example** 

```shell
  <Private Ip> node-1
  <Private Ip> node-2
  <Private Ip> node-3
```
Then save the hosts file carry out the following commands to change the hostname to node-1 of the master node and node-2 and node-3 of the respective workers.

**sudo hostnamectl set-hostname node-2 â€“static** --> to change the hostname of the master and worker node as required.

**apt update**:- update the packages so that the hosts file can be updated with the changes made above.

**sudo reboot** ---> Then reboot the instances to make the changes to work as needed.

# 3. Making the node-1 as the master node and then joining the other nodes to the same to cluster.

**RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS**

@@ on node -1

```vi /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie``` to get the cookie string which rabbitmq will use inorder to communicate with other nodes.
Then restart the rabbitmq service:- systemctl restart rabbitmq-server

@@@ then replace the cookie string which you got above in the same path of which is mentioned above in node2 and node3 

Before that ensure that app has started in the node-1 or else you can start it with the command:- sudo rabbitmqctl start_app

```shell
    sudo rabbitmqctl stop_app

> **_NOTE:_** :- If the worker nodes do not join with the above command then in that case check that following ports are opened on firewall settings of your instances or servers. 
1. **4369**: epmd, a helper discovery daemon used by RabbitMQ nodes and CLI tools
2. **6000-6500**: used by RabbitMQ Stream replication
3. **25672**: used for inter-node and CLI tools communication (Erlang distribution server port) and is allocated from a dynamic range (limited to a single port by default, computed as AMQP port + 20000). Unless external connections on these ports are really necessary (e.g. the cluster uses federation or CLI tools are used on machines outside the subnet), these ports should not be publicly exposed. See networking guide for details.
4. **35672-35682**: used by CLI tools (Erlang distribution client ports) for communication with nodes and is allocated from a dynamic range (computed as server distribution port + 10000 through server distribution port + 10010).
5. **5671** :- amqp/ssl port
6. **15671** :- https /ssl port
7. **5672** :- amqp port
8. **15672** :- http port

> **_NOTE:_** :- You can also check other ports according to the need of your application.
